This Mastermind game was pair-programmed in vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 by Johanna Fulghum and Giulia Lake.

We used HTML5 canvas to render the cursor balls, styled the game using CSS, and wrote the game logic and rendered the game using vanilla Javascript.

The game also features a test suite in Jasmine to ensure correct game logic and functionality.

For further improvements:
Link to a separate page that has the rules of the game. We purposely decided not to crowd the screen with the instructions.
Style the submit button.
Write a reset game button so that you can restart the game without refreshing.
Include a visualization where when you win the balls fly all over the screen like in spider soliitare.

Special thanks to Mike Semko, John Dominguez, Patrick Fulghum and Alice Kong for their guidance and creative suggestions! Additional thank you to Charles Fulghum, tester extraordinaire!
