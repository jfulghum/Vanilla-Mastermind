This Mastermind game was pair-programmed in vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 by Johanna Fulghum and Giulia Lake.

Vanilla Mastermind is mobile responsive, displays animations when a user makes a completely incorrect guess, and features a test suite in Jasmine to ensure correct game logic and functionality.

Special thanks to Mike Semko, John Dominguez, Patrick Fulghum and Alice Kong for their guidance and creative suggestions. Additional thank you to Charles Fulghum, tester extraordinaire.

For further improvements:
Write a reset game button to restart the game without refreshing.
Include a visualization where when you win the balls fly all over the screen like in spider solitaire.
